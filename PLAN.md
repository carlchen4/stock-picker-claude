## Key Components

### XGBoost Ensemble

| Model | Purpose | Blend |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Regressor | Predict next-month return | 50% |
| Classifier | Predict top-quintile membership | 50% |

Both use time-decay sample weights (half-life 12 months).

### Double Machine Learning

Estimates the **causal** effect of momentum signals on returns:
1. Predict Y (return) from X (features) → residual E_Y
2. Predict T (treatment signal) from X → residual E_T
3. OLS: E_Y ~ E_T → theta (causal effect)

Uses `TimeSeriesSplit` with gap=1 to prevent temporal leakage.

### Constraints (30+ rules)

- **Liquidity:** min ADV $1M, price $2–$400
- **Fundamentals:** PE 0–150, ROE 0–200%, market cap > $800M
- **Concentration:** max 4 per GICS sector, 2 gold miners, 1 base metal
- **Turnover:** rank buffer 18, score tolerance 1.5%, max 4 changes/month
- **Risk:** VIX scaling, drawdown halt at -15%

### Features

Default: `USE_MOMENTUM_PCA = True` collapses the four raw momentum
horizons into two PCA components (`mom_pc1`, `mom_pc2`). Toggle the
flag in `picker.py` to A/B against the raw-momentum baseline.

| Category | Features | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Momentum | mom_pc1, mom_pc2 (PCA-compressed) | raw mom_{1,3,6,12}m fall back when flag off |
| Volatility | 20d, 60d, ratio | |
| Technical | RSI, Bollinger Z, 52w high ratio | |
| Volume | ADV rank | |
| Macro | Oil, CAD, rates, TSX, gold, VIX | |
| Fundamental | ROE, PE, div yield, EV/EBITDA, debt/equity | sector-median imputed (PIT disabled, see history) |
| Sector | GICS code | not normalized |
| Earnings surprise | most recent Surprise(%) within 3-month window | DML treatment only, not a model feature |

All numeric features get cross-sectional rank normalization (per
month, to `[-1, +1]`) into `*_norm` companion columns; originals
stay intact so `fwd_ret` keeps raw return units.

## Usage

```bash
cd ~/Documents/stock-picker-claude
source venv/bin/activate

python picker.py pick           # Current month top picks
python picker.py backtest       # Walk-forward backtest (~2-3 min)
python picker.py both           # Both

python smoke_test.py            # End-to-end pipeline sanity check (~30s)
python diagnose_holdings.py     # Why each holding did/didn't make picks
python diagnose_constraints.py  # Which constraint rejected a given ticker
```

### Setup

```bash
cp portfolio_config.example.py portfolio_config.py
# edit portfolio_config.py with your TSX holdings
```

`portfolio_config.py` is gitignored — real holdings stay local. When
non-empty, the rebalancing band prefers keeping them across runs.

## What Was Removed (from legacy picker_ca.py)

- LightGBM, PyTorch MLP, MC Dropout inference
- FMP API, SimFin API, SEDI insider scraping
- Black-Litterman optimization
- Sensitivity analysis grid search
- HTML/PDF report generation, email sending
- All class-based structures

---

## Potential Enhancements

_All planned enhancements complete. See "Tried and Rejected" below for items that didn't survive measurement._

### Tried and Rejected

- **PIT fundamentals (2026-05-16)**: Wiring `compute_pit_fundamentals` into `build_panel` regressed the backtest by ~3pp annualized (Sharpe 0.83 → 0.76). yfinance's 5-8-quarter limit means PIT data only covers the last ~12-15 months of each training window; the resulting mixed-coverage signal trained worse than uniform sector-median imputation. The function is preserved in `picker.py` for future use with a deeper fundamentals source.

## Dependencies

```
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, yfinance, scipy
lxml  (required by yfinance.get_earnings_dates HTML scraper)
torch, lightgbm (optional, not used in picker.py)
matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, jupyter (for analysis)
```

## Session History

### 2026-05-16 — initial productionization

Took the rewrite from "compiles" to "produces realistic numbers with a
known baseline." Final backtest (47 months, 2022-05 → 2026-03):

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Portfolio annualized | **+25.6%** |
| Benchmark (XIU.TO) annualized | +15.8% |
| Excess | **+9.8%** annualized |
| Sharpe | **1.10** |
| Max drawdown | −15.8% |
| Hit rate | 55.3% |

**Bugs fixed (these will rot the next rewrite if reintroduced):**

1. `apply_constraints` crashed on multi-ticker `yf.download` output —
   `price_df[ticker]` returns an OHLCV DataFrame, not a Close Series,
   so `last_price` comparisons hit ambiguous truthiness. Fix: route
   all 4 sites through `get_ohlcv(price_df, ticker)`.
2. **The big one**: `cross_sectional_normalize` was overwriting
   `mom_1m` to a `[-1, +1]` rank *before* `add_labels` derived
   `fwd_ret` from it. The XGBoost regressor was being trained to
   predict ranks, and `walk_forward` compounded those ranks as if
   they were monthly returns — XIU.TO appeared to return +200%/yr in
   2024. Fix: `add_labels` runs before normalize; normalize writes to
   `_norm` suffix columns instead of mutating originals.

**Enhancements landed:**

- **PCA momentum compression** (`USE_MOMENTUM_PCA = True`): biggest
  single win, Sharpe 0.83 → 1.10. Four collinear momentum horizons
  were giving XGBoost more redundant noise than it could deduplicate.
- **Earnings surprise as DML treatment**: pulls `Surprise(%)` from
  `yfinance.get_earnings_dates` (needs `lxml`). Sharpe 0.78 → 0.83.
- **`portfolio_config.py`**: gitignored, populated from
  `.example.py`. Enables the rebalancing band's incumbency
  preservation. Empty list = fresh ranking every run.
- **Vol-spike filter exempts current holdings**: anti-pump filters
  apply to *new* picks, not stocks you already own. RY/ENB were
  getting dropped post-earnings without this.
- **Smoke test** (`smoke_test.py`): asserts the invariants that would
  catch both major bugs (Series-vs-scalar, rank-as-return). Run after
  any non-trivial change.
- **Diagnostic scripts** (`diagnose_holdings.py`,
  `diagnose_constraints.py`): re-runnable when a holding drops
  unexpectedly. The vol-spike fix above came directly from these.

**TSX universe cleanup:** 95 → 93 active tickers. Renamed
TECK.TO → TECK-B.TO, ATA.TO → ATS.TO; removed ERF.TO, SSL.TO, AND.TO
(all acquired/delisted by 2024-2026).

**Tried and rejected:** PIT fundamentals (see "Tried and Rejected"
above) — yfinance's quarterly history is too shallow to be useful.
